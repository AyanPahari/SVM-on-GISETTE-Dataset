# SVM on GISETTE Dataset

GISETTE (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
datasets/Gisette) is a handwritten digit recognition problem. The problem is to separate
the highly confusible digits ‘4’ and ‘9’. This dataset is one of five datasets of the NIPS 2003 
feature selection challenge.

We will work on the following:

    (a) Standard run: Use all the 6000 training samples from the training set to train the
    model, and test over all test instances, using the linear kernel. Report the train error,
    test error, and number of support vectors.

    (b) Kernel variations: In addition to the basic linear kernel, investigate two other standard
    kernels: RBF (a.k.a. Gaussian kernel; set γ = 0.001), Polynomial kernel (set degree = 2, coef0 = 1; e.g, (1 + x^Tx)^2. Which kernel yields the lowest training error? Report
    the train error, test error, and number of support vectors for both these kernels.
